            The Cypress e2e tests are failing on this branch.
            Run the tests with `bunx cypress run`, read the failure output,
            identify what's wrong in the source code, and fix it.
            Only modify files in src/. Do not modify test files.
            Create a new branch and submit a PR with the fix
            targeting the branch: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
